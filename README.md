# Unsupervised learning in Python
*Shirin Abousalih, Rana Youssef & Eric Martinet*

**Data Analytics bootcamp @IronHack Paris, Feb-Apr 22**

## Project description

The goal of this project is to practice unsupervised machine learning (clustering) using Uber trips data (New-York / August 2014).

## Expectations
- Clean, well-commented code
- Clean data with EDA
- Clear description of each model
- At least 3 different models including Kmeans and DBSCAN
- Use Elbow method
- Use folium library to create the map
- Models implementation and comparison
- Vizualisation of the main results

## Repo organisation
- [data](./data): original and cleaned data
- [notebook](./notebook): Jupyter notebooks to clean & explore data, and one notebook for each SL model


## Results
In our case (data cleaning & encoding, selection of models, features selection and hyperparameters tuning), the best model is the decision tree classifier, while Gaussian NB and Voting Classifier can do a good enough job.

However, we reject the Quadractics Discrimimant Analysis.
